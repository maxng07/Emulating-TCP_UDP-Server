Emulating TCP and UDP Server

This is a  module for emulating a TCP or UDP Server. It has an external configuration file, config.json that takes in parameters for ther server.
CONN_HOST - The hostname or IP address of the server or FQDN
CONN_PORT - The TCP or UDP portnumber
CONN_TYPE - TCP or UDP
MSG - The customised message the server will send back to the connecting client

Starting up the server, it listens on the configured port and waits for connection. It responds back with the customised message if the connecting client sends a message, then the connection is closed. This module can be used together with Emulating TCP_UDP Client to walk through a typical network transport connection. The module can also act as a Client connecting home.
